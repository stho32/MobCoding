# MobCoding
My experiences and ideas about mob programming

## What is mob coding?

You are coding in a group of more than 2 people. The group has only one computer where the work is done. Everybody is watching this one computer. 

## Different roles

### Driver

The dude on the keyboard. Preferably the one that has the most less amount of knowledge about the thing that goes on. This way he/she is in the position to learn the most, since the knowledge has to go through his/her hands.

The driver may think and propose solutions like the others, but he/she is not allowed type or act on his/her own. There has to be an agreement with the navigators to do so.

### Navigator (1-n)

The navigator or navigators have the job of thinking about the task at hand and the broader picture. 

### (idea) Lead

The Lead is a role that we found in our work and that we are testing out at the moment. To say this upfront: He/she is not a team leader and the role - like any other role - may be passed around the group. But it is unlikely that this is done as frequent as a driver/navigator change. We did not recognize the existance of that role until recently, because our active Lead will be on vacation and we had to think about a relacement in this time.

The lead watches the email box and keeps the list of tasks for the day (support-cases and stuff) and keeps an eye on the tasks for the week. He/she controls tendencies with regards to the teams goals, e.g. tells the team if the solution to a problem should be short and consise or better thought through so that most of the time is focused on the important tasks. 
He always has the next task at hand when people do not know what to do next. The rest of the time, which is most of the time, he is a navigator like anybody else.

One might explain it in a different way: The driver is the dude in the car on the steering weel. The navigator sits next to him and tells him about the next turn and other stuff immediately important, maybe he gives some clues about where the immediate journey will go. The Lead is a guy with the map who is also sitting in the car. He has the journey route for the next week and is looking out for the longer term weather conditions, maybe plotting a different course to the target town on the fly if neccessary.

## Solution techniques

### Different solutions to the same problem

Instead of having big debates about solutions and which one may be the best it is often easier to just try them. This way everybody in the team levels his knowledge up and we have less of a political arguement going on. ("We should have used x but y is sooo not smart ...").
